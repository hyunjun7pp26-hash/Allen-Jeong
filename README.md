# Hi, I’m Allen Jeong 

## About Me
I am a senior high school student with a strong interest in computing, software development, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy designing and coding applications that solve practical problems, especially those related to communication and accessibility.

My long-term goal is to study computer science and build a career in a collaborative workplace where I can contribute to technology that connects people across cultures and languages.
